# Weather Application  

Hello, welcome fellow!

This is a tiny application that I developed just to make use of some code that I've developed when studying about design patterns.

You can check it out here:
[Observer Pattern](https://github.com/leviermonaites/head-first-design-patterns-exercises/tree/master/ObserverPattern/Problems/MySolution)

I may grow the application a little bit more, if I decide to do so, I'll take the code from there, and start to develop the new features here from this repo.
